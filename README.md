This repository includes information required to replicate the analysis of a quasi-experiment that occurred in Malawi in 2015/16, when two surveys were conducted at approximately the same time, with the same sampling frame and with similarly trained interviewers, but with different age-related eligibility criteria. This analysis provides some evidence that survey interviewers manipulate age data in ways that reduce their workload. 
The repository includes a description of data sources and access modalities, as well as a R script that generates the main figure from raw data files.
